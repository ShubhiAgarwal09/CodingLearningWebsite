# Coding Learning Website
My aim is to design a website a tutorial coding learning website where with the help of various
learning tools like PPTs, quizzes as well as assignment. Register page will help the user to
login and in future would be able to sign in with his/her info and would also be able to see from
where they have left . This all will be done with the help of database management system in
which SQL will take it part .

Also the user can connect with me via social media platforms and can also provide the
feedback along with ratings to my website to help improve in future . Also a chatbots has been
implemented in the FAQ section so as to make the website more interactive . This has been
achieved with the help of JavaScript. The website has also been made responsive with the help
of media queries in HTML and CSS and also Bootstrap framework has been used .
